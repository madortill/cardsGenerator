custom input not typing when first typing

check card type only in one place, so it will be easier to add card types


----------- Explanation -------------------
Each parent gives prop (pathArray) to the child with the path to the child, meaning the entries to reach
 the parent + the level name of the child ('DATA', 'learningContent', 'topic') and its index

svg gets colors from the father component

components that ends with "Input" change their own (do not use a setter)

InfoScreen sends its info to editStage and editStage updates the store

In secondary.vue, we rerender the DragToOrder component when we add / remove card so it could get the new array as prop and save it  to its data.
(for performance reasons, all changes on drag are done on array in the component data inside DragToOrder, and they update the parent component only on drop)
